   ```
2. Run the installer script. It will create `./data` directory and `./.apikey` file they will be created realtive to the
   location of the `receiver.sh`
   ```shell

2. In the modal that opens, you'll find 2 input fields and one switch. Enter the API key shown in the console
   - If you don't have the API key anymore, navigate to the directory where srtla-receiver is installed and run `cat .apikey`
3. Click "Save" after entering the API key
4. On the next screen, a new "Add Stream" button will appear. Click it and optionally fill in a description

### NOALBS Integration

To use the SRTla Receiver with NOALBS, you can specify the statistics endpoint in your NOALBS configuration. This allows
for automatic scene switching based on stream metrics.
Example NOALBS configuration:

```json
{
   # rest of the config ...
      "switcher": {
         # rest of the config ...
            "streamServers": [
                {
                  "streamServer": {
                     "type": "OpenIRL",
                     "statsUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/stats/play_60a0055a7fdb436d92fab3a943f5c55c"
                  },
                  "name": "Stream",
                  "priority": 0,
                  "enabled": true
               }
            ]
         # rest of the config ...
      }
   # rest of the config ...
}
```

{
   # rest of the config ...
      "switcher": {
         # rest of the config ...

                     "publisher": "live"
                  },
                  "name": "Stream",

      }
   # rest of the config ...
}

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the SRTla Receiver, ensure that:

- All required ports (5000/udp, 4000/udp, 4001/udp, 8080/tcp) are accessible
- Stream IDs are correctly formatted
- Your firewall settings allow UDP traffic on the configured ports
